## Logging

- Prefer composition over inheritance
  - I was doing this at HP using composition
- Compose a logging alternative of each of your modules
- This will also include the ability to log when an exception occurs

How this work in Java, how this works in JavaScript.

When to use AOP?
 - When I have a point cut strategy which is not fragile.
   - One of the easiest applications for this I think is literally add to everything.  An example of this is NewRelic - good use case.
